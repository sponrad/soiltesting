      <h2>About DensityPro</h2>
      <p>DensityPro is software to aid soils engineers and soils technicians as they perform construction density testing. It was created by a practicing soils engineer and is a modern approach to this type of work.</p>
      <p>Density testing is performed during the construction phase of a project as part of quality control. Density testing is required in most areas whenever soil or asphalt is being used in the support of a structure including: buildings, roads, bridges, slopes, retaining walls, and more. The density of the material used is tested following it being compacted, usually in small incremental layers called "lifts".</p>
      <p>Tests are typically performed by a soils engineer or soils technician using density testing equipment including sand cones and nuclear density gauges. The number of density tests taken throughout the life of a project varies depending on the size and length of the project; test numbers between the tens and in the thousands are typical.</p>
      <p>Tests taken during construction yield several parameters about the compacted material including wet density, moisture content, and dry density. These parameters are compared to numbers obtained from standardized laboratory tests to determine the quality of the work completed. Typically the dry density measured in the field is compared with the maximum dry density obtained in a laboratory setting and a percentage is returned, this percentage is called the relative density, as it is relative to the laboratory number. Common specified relative density percentages range from 85% to 95% depending on the intended use of the compacted material.</p>
      <p>As a project goes on, laboratory theoretical density numbers and in-field density numbers are tracked on paper and carried by the soils engineer or soils technician between their office and the job site. The amount of paper often becomes unweildy and usually needs to be digitized by hand either during the job or at the end.</p>
